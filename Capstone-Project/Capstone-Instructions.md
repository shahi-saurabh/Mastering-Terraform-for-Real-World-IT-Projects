# Capstone Project: Build a Complete, Scalable Web Application Infrastructure with Azure

## Objective
Apply all learned Terraform concepts to design, build, and deploy a production-grade, scalable web application infrastructure on Azure.

## Theory

This project simulates a real-world scenario where you must provision, secure, and automate a cloud environment for a web application. You will use modules, variables, remote state, CI/CD, and best practices.

## Practical Steps
1. **Set up a VPC (Virtual Network) with subnets, route tables, and security groups.**
2. **Provision Azure VMs (or EC2 if AWS) with autoscaling and load balancing.**
3. **Deploy storage (Azure Blob or S3), a managed database (Azure SQL or RDS), and a serverless function (Azure Functions or Lambda).**
4. **Configure remote state and version control for collaboration.**
5. **Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.**

## Real Case Scenario

**Scenario:**
A SaaS company needs to launch a new product with high availability, scalability, and security requirements. The team must collaborate, automate deployments, and ensure disaster recovery.

**Solution:**
They use Terraform to define all infrastructure, store state remotely, and automate deployments with CI/CD. Modules are used for each component, and best practices are followed for security and collaboration.

**Outcome:**
- Rapid, reliable product launch
- Easy scaling and updates
- Secure, auditable infrastructure
- Effective team collaboration
