# Lesson 7.3: Version Control and Collaboration

## Theory

**Version Control** (e.g., Git) is essential for tracking changes, collaborating, and rolling back infrastructure code. Using remote backends with CI/CD tools enables safe, collaborative workflows.

**Best Practices:**
- Use feature branches and pull requests for changes
- Require code reviews and approvals
- Store state remotely for team access

## Practical Example

**Collaborative workflow with Git and remote state:**
1. Developers create feature branches for infrastructure changes.
2. Pull requests are reviewed and merged into main.
3. CI/CD pipeline runs Terraform plan and apply.
4. State is stored in S3 or another remote backend.

## Real Case Scenario

**Scenario:**
A global team needs to collaborate on infrastructure while avoiding conflicts and ensuring traceability.

**Solution:**
They use GitHub for version control, S3 for remote state, and GitHub Actions for automation. All changes are reviewed and approved before deployment.

**Outcome:**
- Safe, auditable infrastructure changes.
- Improved team collaboration.
- Easy rollback and troubleshooting.
