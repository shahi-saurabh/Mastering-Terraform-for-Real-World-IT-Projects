# Lesson 8.2: Terraform Best Practices

## Theory

**Best Practices** help ensure your Terraform code is secure, maintainable, and scalable.

**Key Practices:**
- Use modules for reusable code
- Store state remotely and securely
- Use variables and outputs for flexibility
- Version control all code
- Use workspaces for environment separation
- Protect sensitive data (e.g., use `sensitive = true`)

**Structuring Code:**
- Organize by environment, module, and resource type
- Use clear naming conventions

## Practical Example

**Secure state and secrets:**
```hcl
terraform {
	backend "s3" {
		bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
		key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
		region         = "us-east-1"
		encrypt        = true
		dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
	}
}

variable "db_password" {
	type      = string
	sensitive = true
}
```

## Real Case Scenario

**Scenario:**
A large enterprise needs to manage hundreds of resources across multiple teams and environments.

**Solution:**
They implement modules, remote state, and strict code reviews, and use workspaces for environment separation.

**Outcome:**
- Scalable, maintainable infrastructure code.
- Improved security and compliance.
- Faster onboarding and fewer errors.
