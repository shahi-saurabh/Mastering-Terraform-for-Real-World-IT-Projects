# Lesson 8.3: Working with Teams

## Theory

**Collaboration** is key for successful infrastructure management. Teams should use version control, code reviews, and remote state to work together safely and efficiently.

**Best Practices:**
- Use pull requests and code reviews
- Store state remotely for shared access
- Document code and processes
- Use modules for standardization

## Practical Example

**Collaborative workflow:**
1. Developers work on feature branches
2. Submit pull requests for review
3. Merge to main after approval
4. CI/CD pipeline applies changes

## Real Case Scenario

**Scenario:**
A global DevOps team needs to manage infrastructure across multiple time zones and projects.

**Solution:**
They use GitHub for code collaboration, S3 for remote state, and regular documentation updates. All changes are peer-reviewed.

**Outcome:**
- Fewer conflicts and errors
- Improved knowledge sharing
- Faster, safer deployments
